                    <!--  We're going to run an off-campus program over April Vacation that will  immersive in a similar way to how Merrowista in that wit will immersive — it won't be a sleepover but we'll spend whole days together and will have spontaneous, fun moments, and it'll be intense in that people will be completely involved in what they're doing. 

              Instead of the focus being ropes courses and nature, the focus will be you doing a project that you want to do with computers.  If you choose to enroll, based  on your interests and what you want to do, you'll choose a project and we'll help you do it. 

             To give you a sense of the kinds of things you could make in this program, we've chosen some examples of stuff (personal websites, gifts) that we're excited about that are similar to what you'd be able to make in the scope of the course if you wanted to. Obviously you're not limited to these categories of things,but just to give you a sense of the types of things you could make that we'd be excited to help you with...

             

         <!--  Personal websites — Personal websites an have very different motivations and outputs. I'm going to show a few examples that help people get jobs, act as creative spaces where individuals curate cultural artifacts, and a website that serves as a cultural magazines..!> -->

in addition to creating personal websites that are an expresion of yourself or of the things you care about, you could imagine making tools that help you do things that you like to do. Here are some examples of applications that you could definitely build as online websites that you could "appify" to use on your phone. Techinically, these are absolutely within the scope of the course and if you're really excited about making something like this and don't finish it in a week, we're happy to meet with you after the course to help you keep working on it.  -->
